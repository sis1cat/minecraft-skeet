      * Note that CID-keyed fonts that are in an SFNT wrapper (that is, all OpenType/CFF fonts) don't have this flag set since the glyphs are accessed in the normal way (using contiguous indices); the ‘CID-ness’ isn't visible to the application. */

      * It is not possible to auto-hint such fonts using FTLoad.FORCE_AUTOHINT; it will also ignore FTLoad.NO_HINTING. You have to set both FTLoad.NO_HINTING and FTLoad.NO_AUTOHINT to really disable hinting; however, you probably never want this except for demonstration purposes.
      * Currently, there are about a dozen TrueType fonts in the list of tricky fonts; they are hard-coded in file ttobjs.c. */
