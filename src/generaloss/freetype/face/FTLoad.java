      * Load embedded color bitmap images (provided FTLoad.NO_BITMAP is not set). The resulting color bitmaps, if available, have the FTPixelMode.BGRA format, with pre-multiplied color channels. If the flag is not set and color bitmaps are found, they are converted to 256-level gray bitmaps, using the FT_PIXEL_MODE_GRAY format.
      * If the glyph index maps to an entry in the face's ‘SVG ’ table, load the associated SVG document from this table and set the format field of FT_GlyphSlotRec to FT_GLYPH_FORMAT_SVG ([since 2.13.1] provided FTLoad.NO_SVG is not set). Note that FreeType itself can't render SVG documents; however, the library provides hooks to seamlessly integrate an external renderer. See sections ‘The SVG driver’ and ‘OpenType SVG Fonts’ for more.
      * If the glyph index maps to an entry in the face's ‘COLR’ table with a ‘CPAL’ palette table (as defined in the OpenType specification), make FT_Render_Glyph provide a default blending of the color glyph layers associated with the glyph index, using the same bitmap format as embedded color bitmap images. This is mainly for convenience and works only for glyphs in ‘COLR’ v0 tables (or glyphs in ‘COLR’ v1 tables that exclusively use v0 features). For full control of color layers use FT_Get_Color_Glyph_Layer and FreeType's color functions like FT_Palette_Select instead of setting FTLoad.COLOR for rendering so that the client application can handle blending by itself. */
